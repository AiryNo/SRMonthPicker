# SRMonthPicker

Like UIDatePicker, but without the days.

This is a native, localised monthpicker for iOS, licenced under the terms of the [MIT License](http://http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).  It's meant to mimic the look, feel & behaviour for one of 2 UI elements on iOS:

* A monthpicker that appears for an `<input type="month" />` element on iOS Safari
* A UIDatePicker set to Date-only mode, but without the day element.

## Including in your project

The easiest way by far of including this project is to use [CocoaPods](http://www.cocoapods.org).  Once you've got that up & running for your project, simimply add the dependency to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios
...
pod 'SRMonthPicker'
...
```

Then run `pod install` to install the dependencies.

Alternatively, simply clone this project as a submodule or download the classes, and include them in your project.  Bear in mind this library uses ARC, so you should create a Static Library if your project doesn't.

## Usage

Simply drag out a `UIPickerView` in Interface Builder.  Under the Assistant Editor, set the class of the picker to `SRMonthPicker`.

You have properties to show the year first, along with the setting (& getting) the selected date, plus the maximum & minimum years.

## Known Issues

* When the calendar style is set to 'Buddhist', the years display correctly, but lack "BE" at the end.
* Similarly, with the 'Japanese' calendar style, only the current era is shown.

## Contributions

As everyone says, GitHub is about social coding - I didn't just choose to use it because of my love of git as a version control system.  Please do chip in & help make this an even better project.
